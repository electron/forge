## create-electron-app

Create Electron App allows you to quickly bootstrap a new Electron app using
[Electron Forge](https://electronforge.io).

### Usage

Initialize a new project by running the following:

```sh
npx create-electron-app@latest my-app
```

You should now have a directory called my-app with an ultra-minimal Electron app boilerplate inside.
If you head into that directory and start up the app, you'll be all set to start developing!

```sh
cd my-app
npm start
```
